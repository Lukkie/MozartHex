===== Communication =====
The game is started by sending a startGame(FinalBoard Winner) record to the Referee:
local FinalBoard Winner in
        {Send RefereeThread startGame(FinalBoard Winner)} % Could also assign players here.
        {System.showInfo "Winner is " # Winner }
	/** Can display FinalBoard if requested **/
end


The referee now controls the game and asks the player who has turn to create a move:
{Send CurrentPlayerPort generateMove(Board CurrentPlayerColor ?Move)}

--> Board is a list of move(x, y, color) records, representing only the tiles that have been placed
--> CurrentPlayerColor is the color of the player who has turn, as a string
--> Move is the move that was generated by the player. If it is valid, it will be added to the Board by the Referee (i.e. append to list)


The player never explicitly sends a message to the port of the referee. It will only assign a value to Move, for which the referee will wait.
